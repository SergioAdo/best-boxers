Record: 54-11-3
Years Active: 1923-1936
Known by many nicknames, including ""The Baby Faced Assassin,"" Jimmy McLarnin was an Irish-Canadian boxer who had impressive punching power with both hands.
At first glance, his record isn't out-of-this-world extraordinary. However, he fought many of the sport's greatest fighters and also suffered a few losses due to hand injuries. The fights he did win, though, are very impressive.
McLarnin defeated Ruby Goldstein, Young Corbett III, Tony Canzoneri, Lou Ambers and Barney Rossâ€”all top-flight boxers and some among the all-time greats.
McLarnin was wise with his money and his career and after retirement became a successful businessman, actor and speaker.",,
